## Chris's Dev Blog (Projects, guide, documentation and sometime ramblings

Welcome to my dev blog, I am a tinkerer at heart and wanted a place to places all of my guides and useful documentation for all of the projects I started to work on.
I thought this was the best place. Have a look around and take a loook at the tags to search for anything you might be looking for.
